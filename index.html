            Watched the free 60 minute coding class offered by SheCodes because
            I was trying to find something challenging that I could also be
            passionate about. <br />
            Decided to go back to school and pursue Computer Science.

            Returned to college to finish the Associates Degree I had worked on
            previously. I learned the basics of networking, cybersecurity, and
            programming, starting with Python. Then switched to C++ where I
            learned object-oriented programming and analytical thinking skills.
            I also spent time building games such as tic tac toe, a text-based
            adventure, and different data storage applications. I worked hard to
            complete the degree in one year, even taking summer classes to
            ensure I would. I finished the year with an Assoicate in Science
            Computer Science degree.

            While I enjoyed C++ and felt I understood it very well, I was not
            passionate about it. So, I switched my focus to cybersecurity. I
            spent time studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification until I
            suddenly lost a dear friend and I realized life was too short to
            spend time on something I was not extremely passionate about.

            Returned to SheCodes, where I first learned about Web Development
            and decided to take just the first workshop and see how it went.
            From doing so, I found I could be passionate about this field of
            Computer Science. I am a creative person and enjoy building websites
            from the ground up. I completed all the workshops that SheCodes had
            to offer. Through these workshops I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            React, APIâ€™s, and a touch of AI.

          <div class="col" id="description">
            SheCodes released a new workshop on Python that I decided to enroll
            in because I know Python is such a popular language. I love learning
            and find that I am capable of learning anything as long as I am
            patient with myself and work through my trials and errors.
